1. 
a) - For new malware analysis, virtual machine can be considered as a test environment. 
   - So any kind of malicious action would not cause harm to anyone. Suppose in the host environment, there might be data which can be encrypted by malware.
   - Giving hardware access to the malware would need new classes of threat detection.

b) - Use virtual machines to avoid any kind of unwanted situation while doing experiments.
   - Can run multiple experiments concurrently on different virtual machines.
   - In the host environment there can be only one operating system running. Using virtual machines within the host give flexibility to do experiments on different environment simultaneously.

I would prefer option b.

- hypervisor is a thin layer of virtualization, it's overhead is not that much visible.
- Possible to utilize resource better.
- Controlled seperation of different Virtual Enviroment.
- Migrate resource optimally in case of hardware failure.
- Standardize the experience regardless of the underlying hardware.
- Optimal uses of space, colling system and other resources.
